== dependencies

Not much, to install them:

  make build-depends

== how does it work?

It's based on makefiles:

  make postgresql
  make OUT=/path/to/where/to/build postgresql-8.4

Rules provided:

build-depends::
	will use +sudo apt-get install+ to bring in all dependencies
	required to run the +apt.postgresql.org+ scripts.

setup::
	setup the debian repositories, using +bzr clone+

postgresql::
	builds the postgresql versions 8.3 8.4 9.0 and 9.1 for the current
	architecture (the one the script is executed on)
