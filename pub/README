PostgreSQL for Debian and Ubuntu Apt Repository
===============================================

This repository hosts PostgreSQL server and extension module packages, as well
as some client applications.

To use the repository, do the following:

Import the repository key from ACCC4CF8.asc:

  wget -O - http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -

Edit /etc/apt/sources.list (replace squeeze with the actual distribution you
are using):

  deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ squeeze-pgdg main

Configure apt's package pinning to prefer the PGDG packages over the Debian
ones in /etc/apt/preferences.d/pgdg.pref:

  Package: *
  Pin: release o=apt.postgresql.org
  Pin-Priority: 500

Update the package lists, and install the pgdg-keyring package to automatically
get repository key updates:

  apt-get update
  apt-get install pgdg-keyring
