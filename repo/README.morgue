The apt.postgresql.org morgue
=============================

The *-pgdg distributions in the apt.postgresql.org repository only contain the
most recent version of each package. Older versions are available in the morgue
at http://atalia.postgresql.org/morgue/.

There is no dists/ structure, and the provided Packages.xz and Sources.xz files
contain all packages for all distributions, users will need to choose the
correct files manually.
