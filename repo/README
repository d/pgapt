PostgreSQL for Debian and Ubuntu Apt Repository
===============================================

This repository hosts PostgreSQL server and extension module packages, as well
as some client applications.

To use the repository, do the following:

Create /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list. The distributions are called
codename-pgdg. In the example, replace "wheezy" with the actual distribution
you are using:

  deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ wheezy-pgdg main

(You may determine the codename of your distribution by running lsb_release -c.)

Import the repository key from https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc,
update the package lists, and start installing packages:

  wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install postgresql pgadmin3
