Description: object-relational SQL database, version 8.2 server
 PostgreSQL is a fully featured object-relational database management
 system.  It supports a large part of the SQL standard and is designed
 to be extensible by users in many aspects.  Some of the features are:
 ACID transactions, foreign keys, views, sequences, subqueries,
 triggers, user-defined types and functions, outer joins, multiversion
 concurrency control.  Graphical user interfaces and bindings for many
 programming languages are available as well.
 .
 This package provides the database server for PostgreSQL 8.2. Servers
 for other major release versions can be installed simultaneously and
 are coordinated by the postgresql-common package. A package providing
 ident-server is needed if you want to authenticate remote connections
 with identd.

Description: front-end programs for PostgreSQL 8.2
 This package contains client and administrative programs for
 PostgreSQL: these are the interactive terminal client psql and
 programs for creating and removing users and databases.
 .
 This is the client package for PostgreSQL 8.2. If you install
 PostgreSQL 8.2 on a standalone machine, you need the server package
 postgresql-8.2, too. On a network, you can install this package on
 many client machines, while the server package may be installed on
 only one machine.

Description: additional facilities for PostgreSQL
 The PostgreSQL contrib package provides several additional features
 for the PostgreSQL database. This version is built to work with the
 server package postgresql-8.2.  contrib often serves as a testbed for
 features before they are adopted into PostgreSQL proper:
 .
  adminpack      - File and log manipulation routines, used by pgAdmin
  btree_gist     - B-Tree indexing using GiST (Generalised Search Tree)
  chkpass        - An auto-encrypted password datatype
  cube           - Multidimensional-cube datatype (GiST indexing example)
  dblink         - Functions to return results from a remote database
  earthdistance  - Operator for computing the distance (in miles) between
                   two points on the earth's surface
  fuzzystrmatch  - Levenshtein, metaphone, and soundex fuzzy string matching
  intagg         - Integer aggregator/enumerator
  intarray       - Index support for arrays of int4, using GiST
  isn            - type extensions for ISBN, ISSN, ISMN, EAN13 product numbers
  lo             - Large Object maintenance
  ltree          - Tree-like data structures
  oid2name       - Maps OIDs to table names
  pg_buffercache - Real time queries on the shared buffer cache
  pg_freespacemap- Displays the contents of the free space map (FSM)
  pg_trgm        - Determine the similarity of text based on trigram matching
  pgbench        - TPC-B like benchmark
  pgcrypto       - Cryptographic functions
  pgrowlocks     - A function to return row locking information
  pgstattuple    - Returns the percentage of dead tuples in a table; this
                   indicates whether a vacuum is required.
  seg            - Confidence-interval datatype (GiST indexing example)
  spi            - PostgreSQL Server Programming Interface; 4 examples of
                   its use:
                   autoinc    - A function for implementing AUTOINCREMENT/
                                IDENTITY
                   insert_username - function for inserting user names
                   moddatetime - Update modification timestamps
                   refint     - Functions for implementing referential
                                integrity (foreign keys).  Note that this is
                                now superseded by built-in referential
                                integrity.
                   timetravel - Re-implements in user code the time travel
                                feature that was removed in 6.3.
  tsearch2       - Full-text-index support using GiST
  vacuumlo       - Remove orphaned large objects
  xml2           - Manipulate XML documents in the database
